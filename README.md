# Projects
This repository chronicles my journey of building a portfolio of practical, real-world applications.

My philosophy is to tackle challenges by breaking them down into simple, manageable projects. Each project here represents a distinct phase of learningâ€”from initial concept and design to implementation and deployment. I am focused on iterative development, using every stage as an opportunity to learn a new skill, refine a technique, or master a new technology.

This collection isn't just a final product; it's a living log of my progress as I accelerate toward my goal of becoming a professional developer. Feel free to explore the code, see my problem-solving process, and follow my progress.
